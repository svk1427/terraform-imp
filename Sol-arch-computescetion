Q. oka e-comm app twarlo new product ni launh cheyaliani chusthundi
launch chesina ventaney trafic ekkuva avuthundi , elanti time lo ela app down avvakunda chudali

Explanation
Scaling based on a schedule allows you to set your own scaling schedule for predictable load changes.
To configure your Auto Scaling group to scale based on a schedule, you create a scheduled action.
This is ideal for situations where you know when and for how long you are going to need the additional capacity.

CORRECT: "Add a Scheduled Scaling action" is the correct answer.

Q. oka web app six ec2 servers lo run avuthundi adhi kuda single az lo
by using ALB and ASG but HA ledhu , HA ki proper solution kavali

Explanation
The only thing that needs to be changed in this scenario to enable HA is to split the instances across multiple Availability Zones.
The architecture already uses Auto Scaling and Elastic Load Balancing so there is plenty of resilience to failure. 
Once the instances are running across multiple AZs there will be AZ-level fault tolerance as well.

CORRECT: "Modify the Auto Scaling group to use two instances across each of three Availability Zones" is the correct answer.

Q. oka app ec2 lo run avuthundi dhaniki 250gb avasarm and ah app
daily use cheyru peeddaga kani mrng and afn times lo baga traffic ostadi maximum of 3,000 IOPS
A Solutions Architect must recommend the most cost-effective storage solution that delivers the performance required.

Explanation
General Purpose SSD (gp2) volumes offer cost-effective storage that is ideal for a broad range of workloads. 
These volumes deliver single-digit millisecond latencies and the ability to burst to 3,000 IOPS for extended periods of time.

Between a minimum of 100 IOPS (at 33.33 GiB and below) and a maximum of 16,000 IOPS (at 5,334 GiB and above), 
baseline performance scales linearly at 3 IOPS per GiB of volume size. AWS designs gp2 volumes to deliver their provisioned performance 99% of the time. 
A gp2 volume can range in size from 1 GiB to 16 TiB.

In this configuration the volume will provide a baseline performance of 750 IOPS but will always be able to 
burst to the required 3,000 IOPS during periods of increased traffic.
CORRECT: "Amazon EBS General Purpose SSD (gp2)" is the correct answer.

Q.on-premises db ni ec2 ki migrate cheyyali anukununaaru , the db requires 64k iops
if possible the whole db will be store on single ebs volume

CORRECT: "Create a Nitro-based Amazon EC2 instance with an Amazon EBS Provisioned IOPS SSD (i01) volume attached. 
Provision 64,000 IOPS for the volume" is the correct answer.

Explanation
Amazon EC2 Nitro-based systems are not required for this solution but do offer advantages in performance that will help to maximize the usage of the EBS volume. 
For the data storage volume an i01 volume can support up to 64,000 IOPS so a single volume 
with sufficient capacity (50 IOPS per GiB) can be deliver the requirements.

Q.eadaina server exact ga 1 yr varuku  kavali annappudu elanti ec2 class ni select cheskovali :
Explanation
On-Demand Capacity Reservations enable you to reserve compute capacity for your Amazon EC2 instances in a specific Availability Zone for any duration. 
This gives you the ability to create and manage Capacity Reservations independently from the billing discounts offered by Savings Plans or Regional Reserved Instances.

By creating Capacity Reservations, you ensure that you always have access to EC2 capacity when you need it,
for as long as you need it. You can create Capacity Reservations at any time, 
without entering a one-year or three-year term commitment, and the capacity is available immediately.

The table below shows the difference between capacity reservations and other options:

CORRECT: "On-Demand Capacity Reservations" is the correct answer.

Q. oka game app ec2 lo host avuthundi in single az lo , dhiniki high ava ni ela set cheyyali and users connect over Layer 4

Explanation
The solutions architect must enable high availability for the architecture and ensure it is cost-effective. 
To enable high availability an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group should be created to add and remove instances across multiple availability zones.

In order to distribute the traffic to the instances the architecture should use a Network Load Balancer which operates at Layer 4.
This architecture will also be cost-effective as the Auto Scaling group will ensure the right number of instances are running based on demand.

CORRECT: "Configure a Network Load Balancer in front of the EC2 instances" is a correct answer.
==================================================================
Q. oka app deployed on ec2 instances in 3 private subnets, dhanni internet lo available ga vundadaniki ela design cheyyyali
The application must be made accessible to internet-based clients with the least amount of administrative effort.

Explanation
To make the application instances accessible on the internet the Solutions Architect needs to place them behind an internet-facing Elastic Load Balancer. 
The way you add instances in private subnets to a public facing ELB is to add public subnets in the same AZs as the private subnets to the ELB.
You can then add the instances and to the ELB and they will become targets for load balancing.

CORRECT: "Create an Application Load Balancer and associate three public subnets from the same Availability Zones as the private instances. 
Add the private instances to the ALB" is the correct answer.
=================================================================================
Q.A web application runs in public and private subnets. 
The application architecture consists of a web tier and database tier running on Amazon EC2 instances. 
Both tiers run in a single Availability Zone (AZ).

Which combination of steps should a solutions architect take to provide high availability for this architecture? (Select TWO.)

CORRECT: "Create an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group and Application Load Balancer (ALB) spanning multiple AZs" is the correct answer.

CORRECT: "Create new public and private subnets in the same VPC, each in a new AZ. Migrate the database to an Amazon RDS multi-AZ deployment" is the correct answer.

Explanation
To add high availability to this architecture both the web tier and database tier require changes.
For the web tier an Auto Scaling group across multiple AZs with an ALB will ensure there are always instances running and traffic is being distributed to them.

The database tier should be migrated from the EC2 instances to Amazon RDS to take advantage of a managed database with Multi-AZ functionality. 
This will ensure that if there is an issue preventing access to the primary database a secondary database can take over.

Q. Eadaina oka app ni manam run chesthunnappudu, dhannni business hours lo stop chesi malli restart cheyyali antey ela ?
Explanation
When you hibernate an instance, Amazon EC2 signals the operating system to perform hibernation (suspend-to-disk). 
Hibernation saves the contents from the instance memory (RAM) to your Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) root volume.
Amazon EC2 persists the instance's EBS root volume and any attached EBS data volumes. When you start your instance:

- The EBS root volume is restored to its previous state

- The RAM contents are reloaded

- The processes that were previously running on the instance are resumed

- Previously attached data volumes are reattached and the instance retains its instance ID

CORRECT: "Hibernate the instance outside business hours. Start the instance again when required" is the correct answer.

Q.oka company lo quarter ki okasari large batch process cheyyalsi vundi
e job 5 days run avuthundi by using 15 instances amd 5 hours per day
he company is investigating ways to reduce the cost of the batch processing job.

Explanation
Each EC2 instance runs for 5 hours a day for 5 days per quarter or 20 days per year. 
This is time duration is insufficient to warrant reserved instances as these require a commitment of a minimum of 1 year
and the discounts would not outweigh the costs of having the reservations unused for a large percentage of time. In this case, 
there are no options presented that can reduce the cost and therefore on-demand instances should be used.

CORRECT: "On-Demand Instances" is the correct answer.

Q.ok app ni ALB and ASG lo run cheyyali adhi kuda kavalsinappudu dynamic ga oinstances deploy avvali

Q.An application running on an Amazon ECS container instance using the EC2 launch type needs permissions to write data to Amazon DynamoDB.

How can you assign these permissions only to the specific ECS task that is running the application?

Explanation
To specify permissions for a specific task on Amazon ECS you should use IAM Roles for Tasks. 
The permissions policy can be applied to tasks when creating the task definition, or by using an IAM task role override using the AWS CLI or SDKs.
The taskRoleArn parameter is used to specify the policy.

CORRECT: "Create an IAM policy with permissions to DynamoDB and assign It to a task using the taskRoleArn parameter" is the correct answer.

=====================================
Q.Amazon EC2 instances in a development environment run between 9am and 5pm Monday-Friday. 
Production instances run 24/7. Which pricing models should be used? (choose 2)

Explanation
Capacity reservations have no commitment and can be created and canceled as needed. 
This is ideal for the development environment as it will ensure the capacity is available. 
There is no price advantage but none of the other options provide a price advantage whilst also ensuring capacity is available

Reserved instances are a good choice for workloads that run continuously. This is a good option for the production environment.

CORRECT: "On-demand capacity reservations for the development environment" is a correct answer.

CORRECT: "Use Reserved instances for the production environment" is also a correct answer.
