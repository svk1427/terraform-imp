it is suitable for mounting via the NFS and SMB protocols.

Best solution for tis:
Explanation
The AWS Storage Gateway Hardware Appliance is a physical, standalone, validated server configuration for on-premises deployments. It comes pre-loaded with Storage Gateway software, and provides all the required CPU, memory, network, and SSD cache resources for creating and configuring File Gateway, Volume Gateway, or Tape Gateway.
A file gateway is the correct type of appliance to use for this use case as it is suitable for mounting via the NFS and SMB protocols.

CORRECT: "Use an AWS Storage Gateway file gateway hardware appliance on premises to replicate the data to Amazon S3" is the correct answer.

SOl:CORRECT: "Use an AWS Storage Gateway file gateway to replace the NFS storage" is a correct answer.

CORRECT: "Use an AWS Storage Gateway volume gateway to replace the block storage(block storage antey volume gateway ani arda, cloud lo)" is a correct answer.

EXP: e scenario lo, company cloud storage vadali anukuntudi instead of local storage , because adhi full ipodam valla

5.manam s3 bucket loki oka huge ciritical/sensitive data ni upload chesinappudu
adhi available ga visible ga vundi evaraina delete cheydaniki veeluga vunnappudu 
ah data protect cheyyali accidental deletion avvakunda

SOL:
Multi-factor authentication (MFA) delete adds an additional step before an object can be deleted from a versioning-enabled bucket.

With MFA delete the bucket owner must include the x-amz-mfa request header in requests to permanently delete an object version
or change the versioning state of the bucket.

CORRECT: "Enable versioning on the S3 bucket" is a correct answer.
CORRECT: "Enable MFA Delete on the S3 bucket" is also a correct answer.

Q. oka application oka region lo all az lo run avuthundi
e app ki storage solution setup cheyyali ela antey, anni servers kuda oke time lo

Explanation
Ekkadaina ec2 ki storage access/issue vundi sol kavali antey first preference EFS,
Amazon EFS provides scalable file storage for use with Amazon EC2.
eadaina app multiple azs run avuthunnappudu or workloads kosam efs ni use chetsa,
alagey ec2 lo vunna efs tho NFS protocol is used to mount the file system.

With EFS you can create mount targets in each AZ for lower latency. 
The application instances in each AZ will mount the file system using the local mount target.

CORRECT: "Create an Amazon EFS file system with mount targets in each Availability Zone.
Configure the application instances to mount the file system" is the correct answer.

Q.oka sol,architect oka app thaluka log files ni s3 bucket lo store cheyyali anukuntundi
itey vatini appudu acccess chestaro denni first acces chestaro telidhu dhiniki
low cost lo solution vundali antey ea s3 storage class use cheyyali

Explanation
"The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class" is designed to optimize costs by automatically
moving data to the most cost-effective access tier, without performance impact or operational overhead.

It works by storing objects in two access tiers: 
one tier that is optimized for frequent access and another lower-cost tier that is optimized for infrequent access. 
This is an ideal use case for intelligent-tiering as the access patterns for the log files are not known.

CORRECT: "S3 Intelligent-Tiering" is the correct answer.

Q. eadaina company valla data ni cloud ki move cheyyali annapudu first file storage medha think cheyyali
depends upon req, ea file system anedhi deceude cheyyali
oka company valla data ni cloud ki move cheyyali anukuntunddi so vallaki 5tb for video procession with max I/O performance
and 400tb for durable storage and 800tb for archival(longterm storage) ki kavali
EXP:
The best I/O performance can be achieved by using instance store volumes for the video processing. 
This is safe to use for use cases where the data can be recreated from the source files so this is a good use case.

For storing data durably Amazon S3 is a good fit as it provides 99.999999999% of durability.
For archival the video files can then be moved to Amazon S3 Glacier which is a low cost storage option that is ideal for long-term archival.

CORRECT: "Amazon EC2 instance store for maximum performance, Amazon S3 for durable data storage, and Amazon S3 Glacier for archival storage" is the correct answer.

Q.A company is migrating from an on-premises infrastructure to the AWS Cloud.
kani ah app lo oka app log files wnindows file system lo stores cheyyali and keep data in sync.

Explanation
Amazon FSx for Windows File Server provides fully managed, highly reliable file storage that is accessible over the 
industry-standard Server Message Block (SMB) protocol.

Amazon FSx is built on Windows Server and provides a rich set of administrative features that include end-user
file restore, user quotas, and Access Control Lists (ACLs).

Additionally, Amazon FSX for Windows File Server supports Distributed File System Replication (DFSR) 
in Single-AZ deployments as can be seen in the feature comparison table below.

CORRECT: "Amazon FSx" is the correct answer.

oka scenario lo sama elaney backup avvali and at the same time exisiting app and backup disturb avvakudadhu.

Explination: The AWS Storage Gateway Tape Gateway enables you to replace using physical tapes 
on premises with virtual tapes in AWS without changing existing backup workflows.
Tape Gateway emulates physical tape libraries, removes the cost and complexity of managing physical tape infrastructure, 
and provides more durability than physical tapes.

CORRECT: "Connect the backup applications to an AWS Storage Gateway using an iSCSI-virtual tape library (VTL)" is the correct answer.
================================================================================================================================================
Q.A Microsoft Windows file server farm uses Distributed File System Replication (DFSR) to synchronize data in an on-premises environment. 
The infrastructure is being migrated to the AWS Cloud.
Eadaina issue manaki windows file system tho ochindi antey adhi on premises or cloud , backup , migrate whatever it is
the only sol in AWS is "Amazon FSx".
EXP:Amazon FSx for Windows file server supports DFS namespaces and DFS replication. 
This is the best solution for replacing the on-premises infrastructure. Note the limitations for deployment:

CORRECT: "Amazon FSx" is the correct answer.

Q.oka app diff multi ec2 server lo run avuthundui and data ni ebs vol lo store chesthundi,
future lo instannce crash aie data loss avvakunda vundali antey sol kavali

CORRECT: "Create an Application Load Balancer with Auto Scaling groups across multiple Availability Zones.
Store data on Amazon EFS and mount a target on each instance" is the correct answer.

Explanation
To increase the resiliency of the application the solutions architect can use Auto Scaling groups to launch and 
terminate instances across multiple availability zones based on demand. 
An application load balancer (ALB) can be used to direct traffic to the web application running on the EC2 instances.

Lastly, the Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) can assist with increasing the resilience of the application by providing 
a shared file system that can be mounted by multiple EC2 instances from multiple availability zones.

"Configure a lifecycle policy to transition the objects to Amazon S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) after 30 days" is the correct answer.

->Amazon FSx for Windows File Server provides fully managed, 
highly reliable file storage that is accessible over the industry-standard Server Message Block (SMB) protocol.

-> eadain app ec2 lo run avuthu dhaniki ASG,ALB set chesi vundi ah app 
lo data every day update avuthunnappudu dhaniki shared storage kavali
sol:
Amazon EFS is a fully-managed service that makes it easy to set up, scale, and cost-optimize file storage in the Amazon Cloud.
EFS file systems are accessible to Amazon EC2 instances via a file system interface
(using standard operating system file I/O APIs) and support full file system access semantics (such as strong consistency and file locking).

EFS is a good solution for when you need to attach a shared filesystem to multiple EC2 instances across multiple Availability Zones.

-> AWS DataSync is an online data transfer service that simplifies, automates, and accelerates copying 
large amounts of data between on-premises systems and AWS Storage services, as well as between AWS Storage services.
