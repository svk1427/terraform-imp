SOlUTION:
----------
The issue here is latency with read queries being directed from Australia to UK which is great physical distance. 
A solution is required for improving read performance in Australia.
CORRECT: "Migrate the database to an Amazon Aurora global database in MySQL compatibility mode.
Configure read replicas in ap-southeast-2" is the correct answer.

Q.oka postgresql db unencrypt lo vundi kani client ki uregnt ga exisiiting and new records anni kuda encrypt ipovali

CORRECT: "Create a snapshot of the existing RDS DB instance. Create an encrypted copy of the snapshot.
Create a new RDS DB instance from the encrypted snapshot and update the application. 
Use AWS DMS to synchronize data between the source and destination RDS DBs" is the correct answer.


Explanation
You cannot change the encryption status of an existing RDS DB instance.
Encryption must be specified when creating the RDS DB instance.
The best way to encrypt an existing database is to take a snapshot, encrypt a copy of the snapshot and restore the snapshot to a new RDS DB instance. 
This results in an encrypted database that is a new instance. 
Applications must be updated to use the new RDS DB endpoint.

In this scenario as there is a high rate of change, the databases will be out of sync by the time the new copy is created and is functional. 
The best way to capture the changes between the source (unencrypted) and destination (encrypted) DB 
is to use AWS Database Migration Service (DMS) to synchronize the data.

e sceanario ki sol

CORRECT: "AWS Lambda" is a correct answer.

CORRECT: "Amazon DynamoDB" is also a correct answer.

exp:
AWS lambda api gatway ni use chesi data ni dynamodb table lo store cheydanki use avuthundi
chala key-value dbs vunnai kani ekkada dynamodb ni enduku thiskunnam antey 
DynamoDB is built for key-value data storage requirements and is also serverless and easily scalable.
and also This is therefore a cost effective solution for unpredictable workloads.

Q.manam rds bd ni customer orders ni store cheydaniki use chestunnam anuko,
ah files store avthunnappudu transit lo db connections anni kuda secure aie vundali app connections ki with SSL certificates tho

Explanation
Amazon RDS creates an SSL certificate and installs the certificate on the DB instance when Amazon RDS provisions the instance. 
These certificates are signed by a certificate authority. 
The SSL certificate includes the DB instance endpoint as the Common Name (CN) for the SSL certificate to guard against spoofing attacks.

You can download a root certificate from AWS that works for all Regions or you can download Region-specific intermediate certificates.

CORRECT: "Download the AWS-provided root certificates. Use the certificates when connecting to the RDS DB instance" is the correct answer.
==============================================================================================================================================
Q. eadaina app create aie, ah data/files ni ec2 lo store/generate chesthundi
and another set of instances analyxe/ modify chestai, but need good storage requirementon this

EXP: 
Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) provides a simple, scalable, fully managed elastic NFS file system for use with AWS Cloud services and on-premises resources.
It is built to scale on-demand to petabytes without disrupting applications, 
growing and shrinking automatically as you add and remove files, eliminating the need to provision and manage capacity to accommodate growth.

Amazon EFS supports the Network File System version 4 (NFSv4.1 and NFSv4.0) protocol. 
Multiple Amazon EC2 instances can access an Amazon EFS file system at the same time, providing a common data source for workloads and applications running on more than one instance or server.

For this scenario, EFS is a great choice as it will provide a scalable file system that can be mounted by multiple EC2 instances and accessed simultaneously.

CORRECT: "Store the data in an Amazon EFS filesystem. Mount the file system on the application instances" is the correct answer.

Q. an app runs on ec2 machines, web app runs on public subnets and db runs on private subnets
bth subnets are in sam az

Which combination of steps should a solutions architect take to provide high availability for this architecture? (Select TWO.)

Explanation
High availability can be achieved by using multiple Availability Zones within the same VPC.
An EC2 Auto Scaling group can then be used to launch web application instances in multiple public subnets
across multiple AZs and an ALB can be used to distribute incoming load.

The database solution can be made highly available by migrating from EC2 to Amazon RDS and using a Multi-AZ deployment model. 
This will provide the ability to failover to another AZ in the event of a failure of the primary database or the AZ in which it runs.

CORRECT: "Create an EC2 Auto Scaling group and Application Load Balancer that spans across multiple AZs" is a correct answer.
CORRECT: "Create new public and private subnets in a different AZ. Migrate the database to an Amazon RDS multi-AZ deployment" is also a correct answer.

Q.oka app already HA lo run avuthundi like ALB, ASG,EC2 etc..but vallaki appudaina suddenga request llimit periginappudu kuda
ea down time rakunda sol kavali

Explanation
The architecture is already highly resilient but the may be subject to performance degradation if there are sudden increases in request rates. 
To resolve this situation Amazon Aurora Read Replicas can be used to serve read traffic which offloads requests from the main database. 
On the frontend an Amazon CloudFront distribution can be placed in front of the ALB and this will cache content for better performance 
and also offloads requests from the backend.

CORRECT: "Add Amazon Aurora Replicas" is the correct answer.
CORRECT: "Add an Amazon CloudFront distribution in front of the ALB" is the correct answer.

Q. oka aws RDS read replica different regions lo vunnai and master db lo vunna data encrypted 
alaney e new replicas lo data kuda encrypt avvali

SOL
Explanation
You cannot create an encrypted Read Replica from an unencrypted master DB instance.
You also cannot enable encryption after launch time for the master DB instance. 
Therefore, you must create a new master DB by taking a snapshot of the existing DB, encrypting it,
and then creating the new DB from the snapshot. You can then create the encrypted cross-region Read Replica of the master DB.

CORRECT: "Encrypt a snapshot from the master DB instance, create a new encrypted master DB instance, 
and then create an encrypted cross-region Read Replica" is the correct answer.

-> eadaina oka company ki rendu vidhaluga use chesina db service kavali
1. complex queries use chestadi, 2. small quries fast ga run chestadi

Explanation
RedShift is a columnar data warehouse DB that is ideal for running long complex queries.
RedShift can also improve performance for repeat queries by caching the result and returning the cached result when queries are re-run. 
Dashboard, visualization, and business intelligence (BI) tools that execute repeat queries see a significant boost in performance due to result caching.

-> ElastiCache is a web service that makes it easy to deploy and run Memcached or Redis protocol-compliant server nodes in the cloud.

The in-memory caching provided by ElastiCache can be used to significantly improve latency and throughput for many 
read-heavy application workloads or compute-intensive workloads.

-> Dynamodb use chesthunna db ki kkuva traffic aie slow access itey em chheyyalantey
DynamoDB offers consistent single-digit millisecond latency. 
However, DynamoDB + DAX further increases performance with response times in microseconds for millions of requests per second for read-heavy workloads.

-> ALB set chesi launch chesina app ki ddos attacks avi avvakunda aapali antey
A rate-based rule tracks the rate of requests for each originating IP address, and triggers the rule action on IPs with rates that go over a limit. 
You set the limit as the number of requests per 5-minute time span.

You can use this type of rule to put a temporary block on requests from an IP address that's sending excessive requests.
By default, AWS WAF aggregates requests based on the IP address from the web request origin, 
but you can configure the rule to use an IP address from an HTTP header, like X-Forwarded-For, instead.

CORRECT: "Configure an AWS WAF ACL with rate-based rules. Enable the WAF ACL on the Application Load Balancer" is the correct answer.

Configure encryption for the Amazon EBS volumes and Amazon RDS database with AWS KMS keys" is the correct answer.
